---implementing Controllers

TODO rather than wasting time learning this thymeleaf platform turn these controllers restful
    using the spring tutorial hateos etc. Start interacting using JS CSS html, then react

    ToDO !!See naughts and cross example for restful example!!

Previous the end to end has been the bootstrap data generation into the h2 database

Now we're only going to be using the bootstrap class to insert static data, for example the type of
electrical devices or types of fixes

The controllers will go on the web side as this is less to do with the model and more to do with how the
user will interact with the web application. For example each web page will have it's own controller


-------Also getting thyme leaf working :D ---------------

Start off with the bare bones html and go from there

I think the onyl mapping spring boot has to start is the default mapping for the index
I think the remaining mapping must be done through the controller, so you should have this in place
before trying to create any web pages
