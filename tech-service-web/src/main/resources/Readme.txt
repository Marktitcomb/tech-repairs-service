---integrating react

Follow all steps from the document you have saved in the helper react doc and copy the
necessary files

index.html -> reacts entry point

client and the other in the api => NO IDEA WHAT THESE TWO DO???

only that clients needed to call your backend

remember you dont have separate web pages, the react website is it's own thing andit calls the backend when it wants
it could have multiple backend calls in one page

webpack.config.js
and the package.JSON not sure what this does either :/
